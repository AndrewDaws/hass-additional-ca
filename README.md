# Additional CA for Home Assistant

_Additional CA_ integration for Home Assistant loads automatically private Certificate Authority or self-signed certificate into Home Assistant in order to access 3rd-party service with TLS/SSL, even after Home Assistant OS or Home Assistant with Docker is upgraded.


## 📘 What to understand meaning private Certificate Authority (CA) ?

* In case you manage your own CA, or you trust a CA, it gives you a kind of `ca.crt` file (or equivalent), that could be named shortly a personal / own / private / custom CA.
* In case you manage your own CA, or you trust a CA, it gives you a kind of `ca.crt` file (or equivalent), that could be named shortly a personal / own / private / custom CA.

* In case you generate a self-signed TLS/SSL certificate, it gives you a `.crt` file (or equivalent), that could be an equivalent of a personal / own / private / custom trusted CA.
* In case you generate a self-signed TLS/SSL certificate, it gives you a `.crt` file (or equivalent), that could be an equivalent of a personal / own / private / custom trusted CA.

📒 This documentation uses 'private CA' or 'self-signed cert' alternatively for the same purpose.


## 📘 What are the use-cases with this integration ?

You want to import Certificate file into Home Assistant OS / Docker container trust store, in order to access 3rd-party service with TLS/SSL:
You want to import Certificate file into Home Assistant OS / Docker container trust store, in order to access 3rd-party service with TLS/SSL:

* Some of your installed integrations in Home Assistant need to access devices or third-party services with TLS/SSL (HTTPS, etc), and you got a ca.crt (or equivalent) from the service provider, you can load it with _Additional CA_ integration.
* You generated a self-signed TLS/SSL certificate for your own service (personal HTTPS Web server, SMTP, LDAP, etc) that you want to be trusted by Home Assistant, you can load it with _Additional CA_ integration.

unzip additional_ca.zip
```

* Move or copy folder `additional_ca` into `config/custom_components/` directory:

```shell
mkdir -p config/custom_components
cp -r additional_ca config/custom_components/
```


### 2.3. Core

If you're running Home Assistant core (Python package) directly on host, you don't need _Additional CA_ integration. You should update your CAs from your host OS.


## 3. CONFIGURATION

For now, _Additional CA_ won't be visible in Home Assistant integrations dashboard, there is no UI component for _Additional CA_ integration. This may be possible in future release.

1. CA files must be in PEM format (often `.crt` or `.pem` extension). Check content with a text editor. Content example (following is a fake):

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
ACeuur4QnujqmguSrHU3mhf+cJodzTQNqo4tde+PD1/eFdYAELu8xF+0At7xJiPY
i5RKwilyP56v+3iY2T9lw7S8TJ041VLhaIKp14MzSUzRyeoOAsJ7QADMClHKUDlH

F10YlqcOmeX1uFmKbdi/XorGlkCoMF3TDx8rmp9DBiB/
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

2. Create directory `config/additional_ca` and copy your private CAs into it:

```shell
mkdir -p config/additional_ca
cp my_ca.crt config/additional_ca/
```

Optionally, you could group CAs into folders.

Directories structure example:

```text
.
├── compose.yml
├── config/
│   ├── additional_ca/
│   │   ├── my_ca.crt
│   │   ├── selfcert.crt
│   │   └── my_folder/
│   │       └── selfcert_2.pem
│   │   └── some-super-ca/
|   |       ├── ca2.pem
│   │       └── ca3.crt
│   ├── blueprints/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── configuration.yaml
│   ├── custom_components/
│   │   └── additional_ca/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── const.py
│   │       └── manifest.json
│   ├── ...
...
```

3. Enable _Additional CA_ integration in `configuration.yaml` and set private CAs:

Model:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
---
default_config:
additional_ca:
  <string>: <Certificate filename or Certificate relative path as string>
  <string>: <Certificate filename or Certificate relative path as string>
  # ...: ...
```

Example:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
---
default_config:
additional_ca:
  my_awesome_ca: my_ca.crt                         # a cert file
  a_super_ca: some-super-ca/ca2.pem                # relative path + a cert file
  again_another_super_ca: some-super-ca/ca3.crt    # relative path + a cert file
  my_self_signed_cert: selfcert.crt                # a self-signed certificate
  self_signed_crt: my_folder/selfcert_2.pem        # relative path + a self-signed certificate
# ...
```

4. Optionally, if you're running Home Assistant with Docker, set environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`:

Example with Docker Compose:

```yaml
# compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: homeassistant
    hostname: home-assistant
    image: homeassistant/home-assistant:2023.5.2
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
      - REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

5. Restart Home Assistant.

After upgrading Home Assistant to a new version, you need to reboot Home Assistant to load again your certificates.

6. Check the logs, look for pattern `additional_ca` in traces (there is not UI for _Additional CA_).


## 4. HOW DOES _Additional CA_ WORK UNDER THE HOOD ?

### 4.1. Docker

If you're running Home Assistant with Docker:

When enabled, _Additional CA_ integration looks for private Certificates Authorities files (CAs) and self-signed certs in `config/additional_ca` directory.

_Additional CA_ loads private CAs and self-signed certs only at Home Assistant startup.

It copies private CAs and self-signed certs to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory inside container and uses `update-ca-certificates` command line to update TLS/SSL trust store.


### 4.2. HAOS - Home Assistant Operating System

HAOS is actually a Linux OS running a `homeassistant` Docker container inside.

If you're running Home Assistant from HAOS or Supervised installation, _Additional CA_ integration works the same way as with Docker, but you can't export environment variable permanently in HAOS, so there is a workaround: _Additional CA_ integration will also add private CA in Certifi CA bundle `/usr/local/lib/python3.xx/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem` inside `homeassistant` container if not yet present (thanks to @nabbi for the contribution).

Thus, for HAOS, your private CA or self-signed cert will appear in container CA trust store and in Certifi CA bundle (both inside `homeassistant` container).

## 5. SET `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

Home Assistant implements an SSL context based on the environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`.

Only for Docker installation type and Core installation type, you may need to set environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

This is optional, it depends on your installed integrations.

Anyway, setting environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` __should not__ break your Home Assistant server.

 > 📝 __Note__: At time of writing, I could not find on the internet a reliable way to set permanently an environment variable in Home Assistant OS. As a workaround, _Additional CA_ integration adds your private CA into Certifi CA bundle if not yet present.


## 6. HOW TO REMOVE A PRIVATE CA ?

Remove or comment CA entry under `additional_ca` domain key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
---
default_config:
additional_ca:
  # my_awesome_ca: my_ca.crt
# ...
```

Note: `additional_ca` domain key need to be enabled in `configuration.yaml` to remove CA files on next restart of Home Assistant.

Optionally remove your private CA file from `config/additional_ca/` directory.

Then, restart Home Assistant.


## 7. UNINSTALL

1. Delete _Additional CA_ from custom components:

Uninstall from HACS, go to your Home Assistant,
* -> HACS
* -> Integrations
* -> Additional CA
* -> From the three-dots menu: click _Remove_

Or uninstall manually:

```shell
rm -r config/custom_components/additional_ca
```

2. Remove `additional_ca` domain key from `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
---
default_config:
# additional_ca:
#   my_awesome_ca: my_ca.crt
# ...
```

3. Optionally remove additional_ca folder containing your private CA:

```shell
rm -r config/additional_ca
```

4. Restart Home Assistant.

If using Docker Compose, recreate container:

```shell
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```


## 8. TROUBLESHOOTING

Some tips to clean your system CA in case of failure.


### 8.1. Docker

If running Home Assistant with Docker:

Either

- (Preferable) Stop and remove HA container, it will remove all changes made inside container, then start again Home Assistant with Docker.

Or

- Manually remove private CA files from `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory inside HA container.
- Then update manually system CA running command `update-ca-certificates` inside HA container.


### 8.2. HAOS - Home Assistant Operating System

If running Home Assistant from HAOS or Supervised installation type, you could reset Certifi CA bundle, two ways possible:

Either

- (Preferable) Stop and remove `homeassistant` Docker container inside HAOS and reboot HAOS. From Home Assistant SSH prompt, run:
- (Preferable) Stop and remove `homeassistant` Docker container inside HAOS and reboot HAOS. From Home Assistant SSH prompt, run:

```shell
docker stop homeassistant
docker rm homeassistant
reboot
```

Or

- Downloading original bundle from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certifi/python-certifi/master/certifi/cacert.pem
- Replace it at Certifi bundle path (to get Certifi bundle path: from SSH prompt, run command line `docker exec -ti homeassistant python -m certifi`).


### 8.3. Tips

To enable INFO logs level, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
```

To check your certificate validity, if using x509 certs, run:

```shell
openssl x509 -in config/additional_ca/my_ca.crt -text -noout
```
